        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> My name is Alain Ayala, I'am at my second semester at McHenry County College, going for my graphics designs degree or if that doesnâ€™t work out, I would like to get a certificate in video editing. I have 3 siblings that go here at MCC and are going for different degree. One of those siblings is my twin brother, so if you see someone who looks like me, theirs a 50% chance that it's me!

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I have many hobbies that I liken to do, but if I had to choose two of my favorite hobbies, it would be playing soccer and cooking. I had these hobbies for many years, ever since I was 6 years old. My parents and my aunts and uncles have introduced to me with these hobbies, and I enjoy doing them.</p>

        <h2>My recreational interest</h2>
            <p>What I would like to do in my recreational times is walk 1 or 2 miles around my neighborhood. I like going to the gym and work out on my arms and legs. I like going outside and playing soccer with my close friends from high school.</p>
