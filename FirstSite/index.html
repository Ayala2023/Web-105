    <h2>Alain's favorite hobbies!</h2>
    <h3>Working out</h3>
    <p>Working out is one of my favorite hobbies to do. One of my favorite excersie to do is
        incline benchpress. Incline benchpress, is basically where you sit on or lay down on the bench
        and you lift bar bells going up and down in a 90 degrees angle with your arms when you go
        down.

    <h2>Soccer</h2>
    <p>Playing soccer is one of my favorite hobbies to do. I've been playing soccer ever since I was
        six, and I just like playing it. I'm really not the best player or the worst when playing soccer, but
        I just like to have fun playing the game. Watching a game of soccer, especially, the World Cup is One
        of the most exciting things to watch. I've always like soccer and I don't wan't to stop doing.

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>Cooking is another one of my favorite hobbies to do. I even have a job that involves with me cooking. I never
        knew that cooking could help me build my personality and helped me handle my stress. Nowadays I haven't done a
        lot of baking, but I definetly wan't to get back into that becasue I use to really like baking muffins and cookings
        when I was little. I wan't to continue building my cooking skills and baking in the future.
