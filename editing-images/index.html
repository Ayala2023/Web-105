        <img src="images/duck-pinball edited.jpg" alt="ducks with pinball">
        <p>I went to image size and change the resolution to 150. I went to adjustments and I
            didn't add to much hue/saturation because the image was already bright, and for
            the curves I just added a little bit of curves. I went to image rotations adjustmnets
            and rotate the image horizontaly.

        <img src="images/kiss-fans edited.jpg" alt="ducks looking at screen">
        <p>I went to image size and change the resolution to 150. I went to the adjustments setting and made
            the image more colorful and brighter, with a low dark temperature. I went to image rotation and rotated the
            image to counter clockwise 90 degress.

        <img src="images/light-ducks edited.jpg" alt="rubber ducks in the dessert">
        <p>I went to image size and change the resolution to 150. I went to adjustments and made the image brighter with hue/saturation
            and I used the curve tool to add a bit more brightness to the image. I even went to filter, and liquify the image to look more
            water type filter, as if the ducks were underwater.
