        <h2>Past</h2>
        <img src="Images/Angel.png" alt="Angel Cupid">
        <p>Cupid was traced back to 700 BC. The legend Cupid was called Eros, Martin explains: the Greek word for desire. The goddess of love Aphrodite would play with hearts of mortals and gods to cause mayhem. For the Romans, the character of Cupid was always a cherubic little boy who followed his mothers wishes to make people fall in love. I always thought that cupid was born around the Greek mythology period, but I never knew the Romans followed his ideology. The Greek mythology was adopted by the roman era, for the Greeks were saw as culturally sophisticated, more understanding the ideology of gods existence. The Romans called the god a cute little kid. </p>

        <img src="Images/Heart.png" alt="Red Heart">
        <p>In todays present, the red heart symbol is mostly used on a lot of things in society when it is Valentines Day. For example, you would mostly see the red heart symbol when you are shopping for valentine items. You would also see on websites that contain love and relationships because red means love and affection. The heart symbol has been around for a long time. Society sometimes thinks that the red heart symbol represents cupid and his bow and arrow. I usually think of the red heart symbol as love and Valentine's Day </p>

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <img src="Images/Pink heart.png" alt="Pink Heart">
        <p>I believe in the future, the heart symbol color will change color, like pink or white, something bright and pure. I also believe that the design of the pink heart would be different, for example; it would have more context on the heart. </p>
