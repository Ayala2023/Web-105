            <h2>Camping at Devils Lake</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Alain Ayala, I attend at MCC, aiming for my graphics design certificate. Today, I’m going to be talking about my adventure’s campouts that me and my family have gone throughout my 19 years of living. </p>

            <p>One state park that me and my family always go is Devil Lake. Devil’s Lake is at Sauk County, Wisconsin. The park is cool and amazing, the hike that me and my family always go are usually great, and we get to experience some great views. After me and my family finish hiking, we would go to an ice cream shop that the park had, and I would always be getting the blue moon ice cream. The texture and flavor of blue moon ice cream is something out of this world. It’s like tasting a different type of blue flavor ice cream. My family and I would usually go to Devils Lake for my uncle’s birthday because he likes it their and he knows everyone will enjoy it. The coolest thing I’ve seen from Devils Lake are the Hawks and vultures that appear flying around the park. I would rate this park a solid 9.5/10.</p>
