          <p style="font-size: large;">This campout was fun, me and my family were experiencing many different site views that we have never seen in our lives. I forgot to describe the reason why you see me and my siblings wearing the same shirt, the reason for that is because my aunt thought it was a good idea to have the same matching shirts for all the kids, for if we get lost somwehere and another family finds us, they can tell which family we belong to. </p>

            <p style="text-align: right;"><br>My family and I saw old building structures that the Native-Americans built, that was cool.<br> Every time it was sunset in that campground, it felt warm and nice, probably because we were close to the west side of the country, so that makes sense.</p>

          <p id="text" style="font-size: x-large;"  style="text-align: center;" styles="width:50%">One time me and my family went to a nigh sky show, where you get to see the stars brighter in the sky, and as I was watching it, the stars felt really close to my face, it was hard to look away, something Iâ€™ve never experienced before. I would rate this camp out an 8/10.</p>
