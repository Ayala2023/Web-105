    <p>I remember one time, me and my family took a 1 in a half hour walk to a beach, where we can see Michigan Lake. The walk was long and boring, I felt like my feet were going to die on me.Luckily, me and my family made it to the beach, and it was really a nice warm feeling. The sand felt fresh, and the waves were fun to run at. It was worth the walk.</p>

      <p style="text-align: right;" styles="width:50%">I remember one time, me and my cousins found a one single slide from the campground that we were camping at, and we just had an idea of having one person goes in the middle of the slide, so not going all the way down just half-way and one by one, we would see how much the bottom person in the slide can hold us.</p>

    <p id="text" style="text-align: center;" styles="width:50%">I remember my fist night camping at Michigan, I thought I was going to get jumped by bears because Michigan is known for having bears in the wild, so my anxiety was kicking in, but luckily that night was fine. I would rate camp a solid out of 8/10.</p>
